# CodeWars
This is a repository where I can publish the katas I'm practicing on the CodeWars website to give folks a rough idea of how I solve the small problems it presents and any thoughts I have on that process!

## Organization
The file structure is broken up into the difficulty classes of katas, ranging from 9kyu (the easiest) to 1kyu (the hardest). Each file is its own solution, with comments contained within if there's functionality I wanted to leave notes on, or if there are thoughts I had on other directions I may take it/resources I used and may want to revisit.
